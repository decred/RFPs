# Alternative GUI Implementation

## Description
A major priority area for Decred and the project is the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Decred software. In order to address this need alongside the development taking place on RFP-1, another RFP is being opened to support a promising user project developing an alternative GUI. Progress on another affordable implementation will strengthen and speed up cross-platform accessibility as RFP-1's outcome is only for Windows at present. Given the priority of GUIs in expanding Decred's userbase, and improving accessibility in full for current users, multiple implementations are encouraged. Attached in Appendix A are screenshots of the current in progress implementation.

## Closing Date

All proposals must be submitted by 06:00 PM UTC June 16th, 2016.

## Proposal

## Milestones
Due to the limited scope of this RFP, there will not be any milestones. Payment in full will be made when the project modifications are completed.

Under no circumstances shall payments be made in advance of work being completed.
